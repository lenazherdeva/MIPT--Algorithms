With all her guests arrived, Anna Pavlovna supervises them smoothly,
making sure each conversation group avoids controversy as well as
boredom. The"little princess," Liza Bolkonsky, chatters eagerly. 
Although visibly pregnant, and once considered the most seductive young woman
in Petersburg, she still makes every man she speaks to feel successful 
and masculine. But when she addresses her husband in the same 
coquettish manner she uses for casual acquaintances, Prince Andrey 
turns away with an involuntary grimace. His bored expression is a vivid 
contrast to the liveliness of his little wife. Anna Pavlovna is 
uncomfortable when Pierre Bezuhov arrives, for he is bound to be rude. 
This is his first appearance in society since his return from abroad. An 
illegitimate son of Count Bezuhov, a celebrated dandy in the days of 
Catherine, Pierre's tall stout figure and his"clever, though shy, observant 
and natural look" distinguishes this mild, bespectacled young man. 
Prince Andrey's handsome face lights up for the first time when he sees 
Pierre, and from their greeting, it is obvious they are good friends. Prince 
Vassily's daughter, the beautiful Ellen, now arrives. She wears a radiant, 
unvarying smile as if to acknowledge her awareness of the splendid 
beauty barely hidden by her décolleté. As she and her father leave, an 
elderly lady accosts Prince Vassily, begging him to petition the emperor 
so her son Boris can transfer to the Guards. She is Anna Mihalovna 
Drubetskoy, a member of one of the best families in Russia. Now that she
is poor and out of touch with her former connections, she appears 
uninvited at the soirée expressly to beg Prince Vassily's favor. 
Wearily the elderly courtier agrees to petition for her son.
